## Definitions

The DIWG has struggled with a definition for the term "swath"
data.  Our membership spans many remote sensing communities and
apparently this term is not well-defined across our communities.
Ideally, we will converge on a common ddefinition to which our
recommended guidelines should apply.

In homage to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, this page
contains summaries of our most recent discussions:
